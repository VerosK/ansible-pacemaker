pacemaker
=========

Ansible role to configure Pacemaker and pacemaker resources.
 
Based on https://github.com/sbitio/ansible-pacemaker work, which was originally
developed on CentOS 6 with Pacemaker version 1.1.10. Current version updated
and tested Ubuntu xenial. More distributions are going to be tested.

This role provides several [modules](library) to manage Pacemaker configuration
with `pcs` tool. 

`pcs` is not available on Debian Wheezy, where `crm` is the tool available. In a
future we may add support for it.

You will likely want to use Pacemaker in conjunction with Corosync. Checkout
[sbitmedia.corosync](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles/690), and make sure
this role is included later. See example below.
